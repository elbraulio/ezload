# How to use

To load your data, you can use **EzLoad** and **EzCol** to set the file format. To do that you have to define each column of the file including the separation expression like this:

```java
Parser parser = EzLoad.parse(",", numberOfCols)
    .withCol(
        EzCol.integer(
            0, "units", new NoConstrain<>(), new ToInt()
        )
    ).withCol(
        EzCol.string(
            1, "names", new NoConstrain<>(), new ToString()
        )
).parser();
```

The final argument `ToString` and `ToInt` is included to make possible to add more complex transformations, these are the default ones. For instance, you can make a decorator where you take the value plus 100 from a number:

```java
class PlusHundred implements Transform<Integer> {
    private final Transform<Integer> origin;
    PlusHundred(Transform<Integer> origin) {
        this.origin = origin;
    }
    @Override
    public int from(String value) {
        return 100 + this.origin.from(value);
    }
}

EzCol.integer(
	0, "units", new NoConstrain<>(), new PlusHundred(new ToInt())
);
```

Now you can insert this using **EzInsert**. This allow you to insert from source to a data base like your are using the `executeBatch()`.

```java
int[] batchResult = EzInsert.fromParser(
   	connection, "table_name", parser, bufferedReader
);
```

# Bots

We are using several bots, this is the current list:

| name                                                         | description                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [Release Drafter](https://github.com/toolmantim/release-drafter) | Drafts your next release notes as pull requests are merged into master. Built with [Probot](https://github.com/probot/probot). |
| [wip](https://github.com/wip/app)                            | By default, WIP is setting a pull request status to pending if it finds one of the following terms in the pull request titles: wip, work in progress, ðŸš§.<br />The pending status can be overwritten by adding `@wip ready for review` to the pull request body. |
| [Stale](https://github.com/probot/stale)                     | A GitHub App built with [Probot](https://github.com/probot/probot) that closes abandoned Issues and Pull Requests after a period of inactivity. |
| [todo](https://github.com/JasonEtco/todo)                    | Using **todo** should be really simple. Once you've installed it in your repository, simply push some code (to your default branch, a PR; doesn't matter). If the code you pushed includes one of the configured keywords (defaults are `@todo` and `TODO`), then the integration will create a new issue for you using the comment your wrote in your code!<br/>To reduce noise and keep your **todo** notes in the right context, **todo** comments made in commits that are part of a pull request will be converted into comments on that pull request. When the PR is merged, **todo**will determine which of those **todo**s have yet to be resolved and open an appropriate issue. |
